# Heart Attack Data ENGL105 Project

This repository contains data about heart attacks in males along with their cholesterol levels, diabetes status, smoking status, and their age.
* This repository contains raw data about factors which correlate heart attacks
* It includes a Python notebook with documentation about how to take the raw data and turn it into something more readable and less cluttered with uneeded information

## Purpose
* The purpose of this dataset is for users to learn more about how specific factors can impact men's health and potentially lead to heart attack cases.
* Scientists can use this data to learn more about how heart attack data works and factors which correlate to increase in heart attack cases.

## Contents and source
* The repository contains 1 [python notebook](https://github.com/aryanch917/HeartAttackENGL105/tree/main), covering how to create a subset of heart attack data from a raw '.csv' file using Python3.
* It also contains a folder which houses the [raw data](https://github.com/aryanch917/HeartAttackENGL105/blob/main/data/heart_attack_dataset.csv)


## Provenance
Sources of Data:
- [Heart Attack Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/heart-attack-dataset?phase=FinishSSORegistration&returnUrl=/datasets/waqi786/heart-attack-dataset/versions/1?resource=download&SSORegistrationToken=CfDJ8GrUjsAKvhxNhvm67MmtKLlgjZbsO35e3qqxjNcEWbRr9oXZI-5VXLfdiZ__f01TxOdpMbzT1C2g_3JDbSj2CD6FXIaB0Lu1t4AVR_TKMO3BhhSeV5cxa76WkI5xMQaVKQFM2enz4B7d76CIe7PVWqkdBFdyYdVmryR6xHK6RIW5Mc0ZP-J8b8KHuStu-yhCfQnGgIktaR6Bzy3GORqu5ut0WENmuWvKWhHMe_lcfsfsfXSh0VAw8kw5vi5aqj4Lw8g51jhxuZ35aF5MkLk_6fjDSjmfNfinHXzw2CSzTexZd8NOCkmhLQSMtSJnXwfMnYW5hXvtW2CilvG-jv8OL18&DisplayName=Aryan%20C)

- The data comes from Kaggle, a website used for sharing and using public data for data scientists to work with and learn about.

## Potential
Identifying Risk Factors:
* By analyzing the correlations between cholesterol levels, diabetes, smoking, and age with heart attack cases, researchers can better understand the key factors contributing to heart attacks in males.

Early Intervention and Prevention Strategies:
* Insights from this dataset can guide healthcare providers in developing targeted interventions for individuals at high risk.

Training Predictive Models:
* The data can be used to build machine learning models that predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient metrics.

Feature Importance Analysis:
* Understanding which factors (e.g., cholesterol, smoking) have the highest weight in heart attack prediction.
